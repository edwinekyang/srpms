# Agile planning

- Agile focus on fast delivery to collect customer feedback
- The feedback then help the team refine the requirements and prioritize task for future iteration
- **Incremental development**

  - Incremental development deliver a working product in every phase
  - Each phase is the increment (of functionalities) of previous phase
  - The functionalities each increment contain is based on the prioritized user stories
  - The first increment would be the **minimal viable product** (MVP)
    - A MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development
  - The product that deliver to the customer in each phase is called a **release**
- **Iterative development**
  - In iterative development, the process of design and implementation would be repeat in every iteration
  - This allow the customer to modify/refine their requirement when the development progress, and ensure that the final product is exactly what they want.

# Downside of Agile Planning

- In agile planning, the project progress based on the team's velocity, rather that fixed due date
  - **Velocity** is the amount of story the team can finish within one sprint
- In traditional plan-driven project, customers pay by the features they receive, however, in Agile, customers pay by hours the development take
- The common concern of Agile project is that the completion time is beyond the customers control
  - However, even if not perfect, the release agile deliver in every phase is still a working product that can satisfy certain amount of customer requirements
  - Plan-driven, on the other hand, while have a fix due time, doesn't imply that the product deliver on due day would satisfy the customer
